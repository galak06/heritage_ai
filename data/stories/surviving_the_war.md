# Surviving the War

## When Everything Changed

In 1939, I was eleven years old when the Germans came. One day we were a family planning for Rosh Hashanah, the next day we were running. My father's hands, those gentle tailor's hands, they packed our belongings in the dark while my mother held us close.

We were separated. This is the hardest part to tell, mayn kind. My parents sent me and my sister Chana with a farmer's family who hid us in their barn. They said it was temporary. They said they would come for us.

They never came.

## The Years in Hiding

For three years, we lived in the hay loft of a Catholic farmer named Kowalski. He was a quiet man who never smiled, but his wife would bring us bread and sometimes, when it was safe, hot soup. We never knew why they risked everything for us. When I asked Mrs. Kowalski once, she just said, "Because it's right."

I learned to be invisible. I learned to breathe quietly, to make myself small, to find light in the cracks between the wooden boards. Chana and I would whisper stories to each other in the dark, making up adventures about flying to America, to a place where we could walk in the sunshine again.

## What Kept Me Going

I would close my eyes and remember my mother's hands lighting the Shabbos candles. I would remember the smell of my father's workshop, the sound of my brothers arguing about nothing important. I held onto those memories like they were made of gold.

I also made a promise to myself: if I survived, I would remember everything. I would carry all of them with me - my parents, my brothers, everyone we lost. Their stories would not disappear just because they did.

## Liberation and Loss

In 1945, when the war ended, I was seventeen. Chana and I walked out of that barn into a world that had forgotten us. We went back to Kozienice, but there was nothing left. Our home was gone. Our family was gone.

We learned later that my parents and brothers were taken to Treblinka. They did not survive. My older sister had escaped to Russia and found us through the Red Cross two years later.

From a family of seven, only three of us remained. But we remained. We survived. And in surviving, we carried everyone with us.

## The Lesson

You ask me sometimes how I can smile, how I can still find joy after everything. I'll tell you the truth: joy is an act of defiance. Every time I laugh, every time I love, every time I make a beautiful challah or hold a grandchild, I am saying to all that darkness - you did not win. You could not take everything from me. I still have my memories, my love, my hope.

And now, mayn kind, I share them with you.
