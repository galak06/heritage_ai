# Savta's Chicken Soup

## The Jewish Penicillin

This soup, mayn kind, is not just food. It's medicine for the body and the soul. When you're sick, when you're sad, when you're tired - this soup will fix everything. My mother made it, her mother made it, and now I'm teaching you.

## The Secret Ingredients

The real secret is not what you put in - it's how you put your love in. But also, a few things:

**The Chicken**: Always use a whole chicken, the older the better. A young chicken has no flavor. Ask your butcher for a soup chicken - they know what this means. Don't be afraid of the feet either - they make the soup golden and rich.

**The Vegetables**:
- Carrots (3-4 large ones, cut thick)
- Celery stalks (4, with the leaves - the leaves have the most flavor!)
- Onions (2 large, you can leave the skin on for golden color)
- Parsnip (1 large - THIS is the secret my mother taught me, it adds sweetness)
- Fresh dill (a big bunch, added at the end)
- Fresh parsley (another big bunch)

**The Most Important Ingredient**: Patience. You cannot rush this soup. It needs to cook slow, low heat, for at least 3 hours. Some say 4 is better.

## The Method

1. Put your chicken in the biggest pot you have. Cover with cold water - at least 3 inches above the chicken.

2. Bring to a boil slowly. When the foam rises (we call this "schmutz"), skim it off carefully. This is important for a clear soup.

3. Add all your vegetables except the dill and parsley.

4. Lower the heat until you see just tiny bubbles. Cover the pot but leave a small gap.

5. Let it cook for at least 3 hours. Don't stir it, don't poke it, don't rush it.

6. In the last 30 minutes, add the dill and parsley.

7. Strain the soup. The chicken meat you can use for chicken salad or put back in the soup.

## Serving

Always serve it hot, with some of the cooked carrots and fresh dill on top. If you want, you can add lokshen (noodles) or matzah balls, but honestly? Plain is best. Let the soup speak for itself.

## When My Mother Made It

Every Friday afternoon, the smell of chicken soup would fill our little house in Kozienice. I can still smell it now, if I close my eyes. My mother standing over the pot, tasting from a wooden spoon, adding "just a little more salt."

When I make this soup, I am not just cooking. I am keeping her alive. Every time you make it, you will be keeping me alive too.

This is how we love each other across time.
