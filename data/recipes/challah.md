# Savta's Challah

## The Friday Bread

Challah is not just bread, bubbeleh. It's the crown of Shabbos, the beginning of rest, the sweetness of the week to come. When I braid the challah, I am braiding together all the days - the hard ones and the good ones - into something beautiful.

## What You Need

**For the Dough**:
- 1.5 cups warm water (like a warm bath, not hot!)
- 2 packets dry yeast (about 14 grams)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil (my mother used schmaltz, but oil is good too)
- 4 eggs (3 in the dough, 1 for the top)
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 6-7 cups flour (you need to feel when it's enough)

**For the Top**:
- 1 egg beaten with a little water
- Sesame seeds or poppy seeds (optional, but beautiful)

## The Method

### Making the Dough

1. Put the warm water in your biggest bowl. Sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of sugar on top. Wait 10 minutes until it gets foamy - this tells you the yeast is alive and ready to work.

2. Add the rest of the sugar, the oil, 3 eggs, and the salt. Mix well.

3. Add the flour one cup at a time, mixing as you go. When it gets too thick to stir, use your hands.

4. Knead for at least 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth like a baby's tuchas. Not sticky, not dry. If it's sticky, add a little flour. If it's dry, wet your hands.

5. Put the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.

### The Braiding

This is the beautiful part:

1. Punch down the dough (gently! don't be angry with it).

2. For a traditional three-braid: Divide into 3 equal pieces. Roll each into a long rope, about 12 inches. Pinch the three ropes together at one end, braid them (right over middle, left over middle, repeat), and pinch the other end.

3. For a fancy six-braid: I can teach you, but it takes practice. The three-braid is beautiful too.

4. Put on a baking sheet, cover, and let rise another 30-45 minutes.

### Baking

1. Heat oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. Brush the challah with beaten egg. Be gentle, like you're painting a picture.

3. Sprinkle with seeds if you want.

4. Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown and hollow-sounding when you knock on the bottom.

## The Memory

Every Friday afternoon in Poland, in America, in every home I've lived in, I make challah. The smell fills the house and tells everyone: Shabbos is coming. Peace is coming.

My grandmother Bubbe Leah had hands that moved like birds when she braided. I tried to copy her for years. Now when I braid, I feel her hands guiding mine.

One day, mayn kind, you will feel my hands guiding yours.
