# Coming to America

## The Displaced Persons Camp

After the war, Chana, my sister Sarah (who found us from Russia), and I lived in a displaced persons camp in Germany for two years. It sounds terrible, and it wasn't easy, but there was also hope there. We were alive. We were together.

In the camp, I met other survivors. We shared stories, we mourned together, but we also dreamed together. Everyone talked about where they would go - Palestine, America, Australia. America sounded like a fairy tale to me. A place where anyone could become anything.

## Meeting My David

In the camp, I met a young man named David. He was from Lodz, and like me, he had lost almost everyone. But when he smiled, it was like the sun came out. He would bring me little gifts - a piece of chocolate, a flower he found growing through the rubble.

"Why do you bring me flowers?" I asked him once. "There's nothing beautiful here."

He looked at me with those kind eyes and said, "That's exactly why. We have to make beauty where there is none."

We married in the camp in 1947. My wedding dress was made from a white parachute another survivor had found. It was the most beautiful dress I ever wore.

## The Journey Across the Ocean

In 1949, we got our papers to go to America. We had a sponsor - a cousin of David's who had left Poland before the war and lived in New York. We had never met him, but he signed for us, promised to help us.

The boat ride was two weeks. I was sick the whole time, but I didn't care. Every wave that passed was bringing us closer to a new life. When we saw the Statue of Liberty, everyone on the deck started crying. David held my hand so tight I thought he would break my fingers.

"We made it," he whispered. "We're free."

## Starting Over in New York

Those first years were not easy. We lived in a tiny apartment on the Lower East Side. David worked in a garment factory - like his father before him, like my father too. I took in sewing and helped in the neighborhood bakery.

But we were building something. Every dollar saved was a brick in our future. When our first child was born - your grandfather, Michael - I held him and cried. A new generation, born in freedom. He would never know the fear we knew. That was my greatest victory.

## Making It Home

America was never easy, but it became home. We learned English (though my accent never left me - why should it?). We built a life. We raised three children, watched them grow, sent them to college. Things our parents could never have dreamed for us.

I never forgot where I came from. Every Friday night, I light candles the way my mother did. The same circular motion, the same prayer. Across an ocean and decades, I am still connected to her, to that little shtetl, to everything we were.

This is what I want you to understand, mayn kind: we are all links in a chain. I carry my mother, and one day you will carry me. This is how we live forever.
