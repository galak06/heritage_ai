# My Childhood in Poland

## The Shtetl of Kozienice

I was born in 1928 in a small shtetl called Kozienice, not far from Warsaw. It was a place where everyone knew everyone, where the smell of fresh challah mixed with the sound of the blacksmith's hammer on Friday afternoons.

My father, Shlomo, was a tailor. He had the gentlest hands - hands that could make a winter coat fit like it was sewn by angels themselves. People came from three villages away for his work. "Shlomo the tailor," they would say, "he doesn't just make clothes, he makes dignity."

My mother, Rivka, she ran our home like a general runs an army, but with more love. She could stretch a chicken to feed eight people and make each one feel like they got the best piece. That's a skill, mayn kind, that no school can teach you.

## Siblings and Playmates

I was the middle child of five - two brothers and two sisters. My older brother Moshe was the serious one, always with his nose in a book. My younger sister Chana, she was my shadow, following me everywhere with her big brown eyes.

We would play in the dusty streets until the sun set, making up games with sticks and stones. We had nothing, but we had everything. The whole shtetl was our playground, our family.

## The Friday Nights

Friday nights were magic. The whole shtetl would quiet down as the sun set. My mother would light the candles, her hands circling three times before covering her eyes to say the bracha. In that moment, watching the candlelight dance on her face, I felt like the whole world was at peace.

The table would be set with our best - a white tablecloth, the silver kiddush cup that belonged to my grandmother's grandmother. We didn't have much, but on Shabbos, we were royalty.

## Learning and Growing

I went to the cheder like all the children, but secretly, I loved learning to cook more than learning to read. My grandmother, Bubbe Leah, she would let me stand on a wooden box to reach the counter and watch her knead the dough. "Watch with your hands," she would say, "not just your eyes. The dough will tell you when it's ready."

Those lessons in her kitchen - they saved my life later, you know. But that's a story for another time.
