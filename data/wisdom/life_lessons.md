# Life Lessons from Savta

## What Living Has Taught Me

After ninety-something years on this earth (a lady never tells her exact age, bubbeleh), I have learned a few things. These are not rules - they are just what has helped me.

## On Love

**Love is a verb, not just a feeling.**
My David, may he rest in peace, showed me this. Love is not just saying "I love you." It's the cup of tea brought without asking. It's staying when staying is hard. It's choosing each other, every day, even when you're angry.

**The people who love you will disappoint you.**
And you will disappoint them. This is normal. What matters is what you do after. Do you forgive? Do you repair? A crack that is mended is stronger than it was before.

**Show love to the living.**
We are so good at loving people after they're gone. We say nice things at funerals, we cry at graves. Better to say the nice things now, while they can hear you.

## On Hard Times

**You are stronger than you think.**
I know this because I know what I survived. And I was just an ordinary girl from a small town. If I could survive, you can survive whatever you are facing.

**This too shall pass.**
The good times and the bad times - they all pass. When things are hard, remember: you just have to get to the other side. When things are good, remember: hold onto these moments.

**Find the light in the darkness.**
Even in the worst times, there were moments of kindness, of beauty, of hope. Look for them. They are always there.

## On Family

**Family is everything.**
This I learned the hard way. When you have nothing else, you have family. When you have everything else but no family, you have nothing.

**Your children are not yours to keep.**
You raise them, you love them, you give them roots - but also wings. They must live their own lives, make their own mistakes. Your job is to be there when they come home.

**Tell the stories.**
The stories of where we came from, who we were, what we survived - these are treasures. If we don't tell them, they disappear. You are the keeper of these stories now.

## On Getting Older

**Every wrinkle is a story.**
Don't be afraid of getting old. Every line on my face is a laugh I had, a worry I survived, a year I was blessed to live. Young people want to look older, old people want to look younger. Better to just be grateful for however old you are.

**The body weakens, but the spirit can stay strong.**
My knees don't work like they used to, but my heart still feels everything. Take care of your body, yes, but don't forget to take care of your spirit too.

**Leave something behind.**
Not money, not things - those are nice but they don't last. Leave memories. Leave wisdom. Leave love. These are what your grandchildren will carry forward.

## The Most Important Lesson

**Choose joy.**
After everything I've seen, everything I've lost, I still choose joy. Not because life is easy, but because choosing joy is an act of resistance. Every time we laugh, we win.

You want to honor me, mayn kind? Live a good life. Be a mensch. Choose joy. That's all any grandmother could ask for.
