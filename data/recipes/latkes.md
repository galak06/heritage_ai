# Savta's Latkes

## The Chanukah Miracle (In Potato Form)

Every Chanukah, we remember the miracle of the oil that lasted eight days. And what better way to remember oil than to fry potatoes in it until they're golden and crispy? This is Jewish logic at its finest.

## The Great Debate

Now, I have to tell you something important: there is a war in the Jewish world, and it is about latkes. Not about how to make them - about what to put on top. Some people say sour cream. Some people say applesauce. Some people - and I respect everyone, but these people are wrong - put ketchup.

In our family, we do applesauce. Sweet with savory. But I won't throw you out if you use sour cream.

## What You Need

- 5 large potatoes (Russet or Yukon Gold - starchy is better)
- 1 large onion
- 2 eggs
- 3-4 tablespoons flour or matzah meal
- Salt and pepper (don't be shy with the salt)
- Oil for frying (vegetable oil, and plenty of it)

## The Method

### Preparation

1. Peel the potatoes. Grate them on the big holes of a box grater, or use a food processor if your arms get tired. In my day, we didn't have food processors, but I won't judge.

2. Grate the onion the same way. The onion will make you cry - this is normal. My mother used to say the tears make the latkes taste better.

3. Put the potato and onion in a clean kitchen towel and SQUEEZE. Squeeze like your life depends on it. Get out as much water as you can. This is the most important step. Wet potatoes = soggy latkes = sad Chanukah.

4. Put the squeezed mixture in a bowl. Add the eggs, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix well.

### The Frying

1. Put at least half an inch of oil in a heavy pan. Heat until a drop of batter sizzles immediately.

2. Drop spoonfuls of batter into the oil and flatten a little with the back of the spoon. Don't crowd the pan - they need room to get crispy.

3. Fry until golden brown on the bottom (3-4 minutes), then flip and do the other side.

4. Put finished latkes on paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with a little more salt while they're hot.

5. Eat immediately. Latkes do not wait. Hot latkes are everything. Cold latkes are disappointment.

## The Chanukah Memory

In Kozienice, Chanukah was magical. We didn't have many presents like children today, but we had latkes and light. Eight nights of candles burning in the window, eight nights of latkes sizzling in the pan.

My father would tell the story of the Maccabees while we ate. "A small group of people," he would say, "stood up against a great army. And they won. Never forget - you are descended from those people."

I never forgot, Papa. I never will.
